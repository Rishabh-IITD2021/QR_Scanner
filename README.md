# QR_Scanner
Build a Robust Pipeline to Detect and Decode QR Codes in Images Using YOLO, Pyzbar, and PyBoof  This project implements a robust pipeline that first uses a YOLO-based object detection model to locate QR codes in images, followed by Pyzbar and PyBoof libraries to accurately decode the detected QR codes.
